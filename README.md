## Description
This is a simple kept application generating the board or the map for the popular board game "Settlers of Catan". You can shuffle the numbers and landfields to gernerate new maps for longlasting fun with the game.
There are already several of these map generators outthere in the internet. What I found missing them all was the social element that you can share and rate the maps.
So besides creating respectively shuffeling a new map you are also able to rate the map like for example on airbnb.

Because this is often asked: How is the layout made?
The board layout is created using

## Usage
Each time you press the shuffle button all landfields and numbers will be shuffled.
